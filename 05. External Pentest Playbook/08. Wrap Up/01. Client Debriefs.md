- Pentest done

- Report sent

- Now client debrief


The debrief is going over the report with the client to explain the findings and discuss the recommendations. However its at high level - speak like they are 5.

You will get asked questions.

Don't be afraid to say I don't know. But research and come back.

Be aware, some clients wont be happy you had findings. They take it personal.

Never loose sight the goal is to make them better, safer and educate.
