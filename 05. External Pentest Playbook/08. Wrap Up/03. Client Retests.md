This will be your organization specific policy.

Fairly standard offer X days to give the client that time to address what ever findings they want.
The team will then go and retest ONLY the findings that were in the original report.

If findings have been remediated, then the report will be updated to reflect that the finding has now been remediated NOT remove the finding.

Make it clear the finding is now remediated, but the finding is still there.
