Social engineering is regularly not in scope. So don't do it.

No user interaction limits options, but can still be done..

Tools exist to test for and check MFA

MFA sweep is a tool
https://github.com/dafthack/MFASweep

Will check account is valid and test for MFA in use

Will attempt multiple logins. This requires known credentials. Will use email and password. incorrect creds risk lock out.


Note - Microsoft 365 exchange web services (EWS) is common to see
This may lead to anther tool 'mailsniper'

This will attempt to authenticate through EWS URL and then search through emails in an account and find passwords

`Invoke-SelfSearch -Mailbox <account name> -ExchHostname<email host name> -remote`

Basically - we are looking for human error and misconfiguration to bypass MFA.
