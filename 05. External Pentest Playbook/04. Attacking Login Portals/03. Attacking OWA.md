#### Password Spraying OWA (Outlook Web Applicaiton)

O365 is becoming the norm, however some organizations still host their own on pre infrastructure.

If during enumeration we find find a login portal for Outlook Web App. We have found the OWA server.

The tool to use here is: METASPLOIT

`search owa`

use a OWA login scanner 
possibly: auxiliary/scanner/http/owa_login

Standard process for set up

`options`

Set a password to try (Winter21!)

Set Rhost

then can use a user name or more likely a userfile > the list of email addresses

Make a note of the OWA version under Auxiliary action. this may need to be changed.

Note - the detection and speed of OWA is not as critical as O365
This can essentially be fired off and you can go away and perform other tasks.. Blocking chance is incredibly low.

Metasploit will also validate users
this does not have lock out protection. you need to monitor it carefully to avoid locking out all the accounts.
