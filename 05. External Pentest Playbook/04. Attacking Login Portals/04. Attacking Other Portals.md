intercepting requests of only  in scope sites.

Make a dummy request and intercept the request.

if through testing you can identify an error messages IE: incorrect email etc.

Alternate methods, is changes in return size and status code.

otherwise more likely, use a cluster bomb attack. set a position on the email as well.
Set standard payloads. Load in email list.

In credential stuffing attacks, the hacker has access to a set of valid credentials which they use to attempt to log into secondary accounts. In password spraying attacks, the hacker does not have access to known credentials. Instead, they try to log into a user account with commonly used passwords.

Go and manually test any possible logins. Note if burp finds a valid login, sometime the very next attempt may also come back as success. Do a test.
