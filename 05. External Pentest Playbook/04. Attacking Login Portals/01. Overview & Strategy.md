At this point, manual enumeration should have identified available log in portals.

Most common place - is usually O365. (try ask during scoping) haha, if they wont tell you. Just go try it at the O365 login portal anyway. it will tell you.

We also should have a list of current employee emails from previous enumeration.

We may have some passwords to try but we should enhance that with a password strategy..

Think <current season><current year>! >>> winter2020!

Identifying the password policy is important - We want to know what it is to enhance our password guess.
when in doubt, assume 8 chars, capital, numbers and 1 special char
Dont forget to back date. It may be winter, but maybe they haven't changed their FALL/AUTUM password.

Think about location. Cities. sports teams in the cities, maybe enumeration identified employees with a fav sports team.
Also, during the enumeration. Think about the business address. some people will use address of the company, or even the company name.
Sometimes people will use leet speak to get their "thing" to appropriate length.

Be aware of lock out policy. Dont be locking out peoples accounts.

Password attacks can take a while. Be efficient. You have a limited time, start with most likely to work.
