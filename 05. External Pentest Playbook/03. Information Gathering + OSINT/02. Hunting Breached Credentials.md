Heath's Breach parse tool - a little out dated but still allows to search by @XYZ and see what has been breached historically.

Your looking to build infomration about;

- Known user emails
- email format; first.last firstintiallastname
- passwords and password hashes
- passwords patterns from users with multiple entries

as your gathering breached creds from multiple sources and co locate them into a single place. the checklist is a good place to centralise it all.

Dehashed.com

A great online tool. massive DB... but has a cost involved.

with dehashed, you can research usernames. This can e handy for zeroing in on potential usabel passwords


you would never attack outside of scopelk, however you can search for and use data obtained form out of scope breachs.

Ie:;
jim@tesla vs jim@gmail. 
The breached password associated with his Gmail account is fair game for his work email.

Remember sometimes it may take multiple rounds of breached password info gathering. 
get the initial list. run the users back through the search try to identify other breached accounts associated with the users, build password patterns.

Dehashed can search password hashes. Does the has show up with multiple users, can we narrow down the password in plain.

At this point we will have a large list of previously breached emails / passwords. probably unfiltered.
