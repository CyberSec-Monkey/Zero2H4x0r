We need to enumerate for valid accounts.

This is the pre attack - although it is an attack, the intent is to validate the emails against a clients login portal.

This will give us the final list of valid accounts before we start trying to breach passwords.

So when using login portals to validate. sometimes the obvious portals will have the appropriate error message, indicating a problem with the username password combination.

Try all the portals but also, try the more obscure portals. Password reset, maybe one hasn't been configured correctly and will inform you that the username is not found or found.

When testing for error message, you can just use dummy creds to get and test a not found message.

part of this step is spending time to find usable login portals.
We want to try to avoid portals that use captures etc to limit or delay repeat entries. limits the need to bypass.

At this point we should have a list of valid users AND a list of login portals we can use later.
