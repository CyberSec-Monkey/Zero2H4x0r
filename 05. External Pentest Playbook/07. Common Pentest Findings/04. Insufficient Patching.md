The discovery of insufficient patching indicates that the system has not been regularly updated with the latest security patches and updates. This leaves the system vulnerable to known security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. It is crucial to maintain a robust patch management process to ensure that all software, operating systems, and applications are promptly updated with the latest patches and security fixes. By addressing this finding and establishing an effective patching strategy, the system can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and enhance its overall security posture.



Another very common finding. Usually a case of client is behind on patching resulting in an exploitable vulnerability being available. This still isn't like finding a zero day. Should note with recommendation, sometimes a patch isn't available yet, however there will usually be mitigation recommendations.
