The identification of default credentials highlights the presence of unchanged or widely known default usernames and passwords within the system. Default credentials are commonly set by manufacturers or vendors and are intended for initial setup or testing purposes. However, failing to change these default credentials poses a significant security risk, as attackers can easily gain unauthorized access to the system. It is crucial to enforce a strict policy of changing default credentials upon installation or provisioning of any system or application. By eliminating default credentials and implementing strong, unique passwords, the system can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and strengthen its overall security posture.


Still exists in the wild! Still very common.

As a rule - always just check if default credentials still work. Including printers!
