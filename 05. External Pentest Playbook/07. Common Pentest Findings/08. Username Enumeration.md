Username enumeration is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to determine valid usernames on a system. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gather valuable information about user accounts, which can be used for further malicious activities such as brute-force attacks, social engineering, or targeted phishing attempts. Username enumeration typically occurs when the system provides different responses or error messages for valid and invalid usernames during the login or password recovery process. This inconsistency enables an attacker to iteratively test multiple usernames and identify those that result in different responses. To address this finding, it is important to implement robust authentication mechanisms that do not reveal whether a username is valid or not. By eliminating username enumeration, the system can enhance its security posture and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to user accounts.

Ideally error messages should always be synchronized. Any variance can potentially be used to enumerate passwords.
