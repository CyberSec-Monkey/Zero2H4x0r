IKE Aggressive Mode is a phase of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol used in establishing secure communication channels in virtual private networks (VPNs). It is a simplified and faster mode of negotiation compared to the more secure IKE Main Mode. However, the aggressive mode lacks certain security features, making it more susceptible to potential attacks, such as offline password cracking and interception of sensitive information. During IKE Aggressive Mode, the exchange of authentication credentials and key material is done in fewer steps, compromising the confidentiality of the exchanged data. It is crucial to recognize and address the use of IKE Aggressive Mode to ensure the security and integrity of VPN connections by implementing stronger security measures, such as IKE Main Mode or other secure negotiation methods.


This is more best practice rather than something that can be actively exploited. Its difficult.
This is more of an identification for the client.
