The identification of insufficient encryption reveals a weakness in the security controls implemented within the system. Encryption is a critical component of data protection, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and secure. Insufficient encryption practices may involve the use of weak encryption algorithms, outdated encryption protocols, or improperly implemented encryption mechanisms. This exposes sensitive data to the risk of unauthorized access and compromise. To address this finding, it is recommended to implement strong encryption algorithms and protocols that align with industry best practices.


Heaths opinion - finding will have the most. Shows up in Nessus and other vulnerability scanning tools.
