Unexpected Perimeter Services refers to the presence of network services or protocols that are accessible from the external network but are not intended or required to be exposed to the public. These services may include outdated or unused protocols, misconfigurations, or overlooked system components that create potential entry points for attackers. The existence of unexpected perimeter services increases the attack surface and can lead to unauthorized access, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and potential compromise of sensitive information. It is essential to regularly review and assess the exposed network perimeter to identify and mitigate any unexpected or unnecessary services, ensuring that only essential and properly secured services are accessible from the external network.


Think RDP or telnet. These should not be accessible on the outside.

When in doubt, just ask the client. Maybe there is a good reason. But ask and then if required document.
