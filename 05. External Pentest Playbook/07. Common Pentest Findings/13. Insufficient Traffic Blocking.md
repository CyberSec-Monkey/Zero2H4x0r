Insufficient Traffic Blocking refers to a security weakness where network traffic is not adequately filtered or restricted, allowing unauthorized or potentially malicious traffic to flow freely within the network. This could occur due to misconfigurations, lack of firewall rules, or improper network segmentation. Insufficient traffic blocking can lead to various security risks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities. To address this issue, it is crucial to implement proper traffic filtering and access control measures, such as configuring firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and network segmentation, to restrict and monitor network traffic effectively. Regular monitoring and updating of these controls are essential to maintain a secure and controlled network environment.


Something to look at but not really assessed during, you have to know the client and know their traffic. Client dependent, where does their traffic need to originate.

An organization should decide where traffic should be allowed to originate from.
This limits attack surface.
