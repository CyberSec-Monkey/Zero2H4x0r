The identification of information disclosure highlights a vulnerability in the system that allows unauthorized access to sensitive information. Information disclosure occurs when system or application configurations, error messages, or other system responses inadvertently reveal sensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, or confidential documents. This can be exploited by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access, perform identity theft, or gather intelligence for further attacks. To mitigate this finding, it is crucial to review and adjust system configurations to ensure sensitive information is not exposed. Proper input validation, error handling, and access control mechanisms should be implemented to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Regular security assessments and testing can help identify and address potential information disclosure vulnerabilities. By addressing information disclosure, the system can maintain the confidentiality of sensitive data and protect against unauthorized access.

Very common in the wild. Usually moderate or below.

Error messages and sensitive data should not be disclosed to the external user. If infomration can help you carry out your test it can help a malicious attacker.
