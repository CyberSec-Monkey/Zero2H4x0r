Open mail relays refer to misconfigured email servers that allow unauthorized third parties to use them for sending emails without proper authentication. This finding poses a significant security risk as it can lead to various malicious activities, such as spamming, phishing, or distributing malware. Open mail relays can be exploited by attackers to abuse the server's resources, compromise email deliverability, and potentially tarnish the organization's reputation. To address this finding, it is essential to configure email servers to prevent unauthorized relay access, implement proper authentication mechanisms, and regularly monitor and update email server configurations. By securing mail relays and ensuring only legitimate senders can utilize them, organizations can mitigate the risk of unauthorized email abuse and maintain the integrity of their email infrastructure.
