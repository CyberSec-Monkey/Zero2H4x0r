The identification of a weak password policy highlights vulnerabilities in the system's password management practices. A weak password policy increases the risk of unauthorized access and compromises the security of user accounts. To address this finding, it is recommended to enforce strong password requirements, such as minimum length, complexity, and regular password expiration. Implementing password policies aligned with industry best practices will enhance the system's overall security posture and reduce the likelihood of successful password-related attacks.
