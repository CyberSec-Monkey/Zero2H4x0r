Default web pages are a security vulnerability that occurs when web servers or applications are configured with generic or default pages that provide unnecessary information to potential attackers. These default pages often reveal sensitive details about the server's operating system, software versions, directory structure, or default credentials. Attackers can exploit this information to gain insights into the system's configuration and identify potential weaknesses or known vulnerabilities. To mitigate this finding, it is crucial to remove or customize default web pages, ensuring they do not disclose sensitive information that could aid attackers in their reconnaissance and exploitation efforts. Implementing secure and non-informative default pages helps protect the system from unnecessary exposure and strengthens overall security.


Pretty common, usually found during directory enumeration.  We should never see default web pages. Its an indication of bad hygiene. Are they unaware of what services are turned on. Or are they hiding something behind it, leading to further directory busting.
