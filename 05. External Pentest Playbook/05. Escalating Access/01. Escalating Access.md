#### Strategy and Walk Through


! you have made it onto a machine.

It is prob low level access.

Enumeration is King.
OSINT. Gather all your info early. You may have found your ticket deeper into the system or network earlier. Maybe an old breached password is still being used internally.

Usually you wil land within  O365.

Begin enumerating search emails for passwords or information about VPN. Default credentials etc.

Sometimes you may need to cycle through the enumeration multiple times. Gathering new data each time and then enumerating based on the new data.

OSINT being able to associate employees with previously breached passwords can assist with passwords guessing. Reused passwords! Spray them around.

#### BIG NOTE: Go to potral.azure.com
log in with found user, you will likely see all users. This can greatly increase the number of accounts you can spray against. more accounts more chances of getting in.
Sometimes, it is also misconfigured allowing the attacker to add a user.
