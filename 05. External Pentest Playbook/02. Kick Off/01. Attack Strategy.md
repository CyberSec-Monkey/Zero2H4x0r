Like your home - Most effort on security is invested in the external facing infrastructure. Locks on external doors. no locks on internal Etc.

What does this mean for strategy, don't waste time and energy expecting to find a big web app zero day or RCE to exploit. Keep its simple and focused. Companies are already investing in their external security. What you'll likely see is weak passwords and weak password policies providing entry. AND a lack of MFA or only partial MFA.

Additionally if you are working a web app as an entry point, don't expend time conducting attacks that would fall under a web app pentest, that is not your objective. If the actions aren't related to escalating from external to internal, then they probably aren't necessary.

OSINT and logical guessing for password attacks will be your best initial strategy. Always focus on progressing the attack strategy from external to internal.
