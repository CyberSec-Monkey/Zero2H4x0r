The start of the pentest.

Kick it off as a first thing. It can take a while so let it run.

Nessus is a great tool but has an annual fee.

can schedule start. 

What ever tool you choose, spend time to understand the scans its doing and how its doing them., 
Ensure the tool usage is allowed in scope (bug bounty) and that its operation will remain in scope.
No need to run automated webapp testing on an external pentest.

Look into how long the scan will take, mainly important on large IP ranges, may need to investigate options to speed it up.

Its a tool to help find quick wins and may provide additional value to the client.
You still need to analyse the results.
