### Scoping and Time Limitations

- Cover your ass by documenting what and why you couldn't do things or limitations on your investigation (e.g., attack types and time available).

### Tester Notes and Recommendations

- More casual tone to improve understanding, describe findings (big picture), and give context.
- It's like talking to them, less "report."

### Vulnerability Summary & Report Card

- List vulnerabilities by criticality
- Recommendations

Cleanliness and presentation are important!

Please ensure to consult with legal professionals and follow applicable regulations when creating and sharing pentest reports.
