**Password spraying and Credential Stuffing**

During passive recon, credentails can be gathered through various tool and collated into a list. <br/>
THese crednetials have been obtained and collated through previous breeches of various services.<br/>
Searching through and filtering down to the company being targets can provide infomration on format of login crednetials and potentailly common or reused passwords. IE &lt;season&gt;&lt;year&gt;.<br/>
Some stolen credentials may even still work in the system.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

2. run burpsuite, set proxy and intercept traffic<br/>
3. enter randome fake email and password &gt; sign in<br/>
4. burp will capture the packet.<br/>
- user= and password= will be seen.<br/>
5. send that packet to the intruder (right click &gt; send to intruder)<br/>
6. Select positions and clear it (clear button) postions tries to auto guess the parameters<br/>
7. highlight the email and click add<br/>
8. highlight the password click add<br/>
9. chacnge atack type from snipe to pitchfork (sniper uses a single parameter, pitchfor... assumed up to 3 - OR pitchfor runs payload 1 with payload 2... so username and password are matched)<br/>
10. Navigate to payloads<br/>
11. payload 1 &gt; copy list of users (email) and past into simple list<br/>
12. set payload set to 2. Copy list of passwords into simlpe list<br/>
13. click run! ignor the warning on free version<br/>
14. results in real time. looking for status code changes<br/>
15. also check actual responce. you could use a grep options... Ie a messege return &quot;we could not log you in&quot; allow for quicker scruitny.<br/>

<br/>
PASSWORD SPRAYING<br/>
<br/>
obtain all the breached credentials during recon<br/>
list the user names... enter or use common passowords.. IE fall2022!<br/>
NOTE &gt; always ask or check with client aboujt lock out. a user could be locked out based on number of inccorect guesses. DO not do this<br/>
dp 1 or 2 then wait a few hours if you must<br/>
<br/>
NOTE &gt; CRED STUFFING AND PASSWORD SPRAYING IS THE MOST COMMON WAY OF GETTIN IN ON EXT PEN TEST
