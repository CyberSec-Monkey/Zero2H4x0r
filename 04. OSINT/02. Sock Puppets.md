Online identity - but is not accurate to who you are. A fake profile.

We should use a fake profile to do research that isnt tied back to you.

This should look legitimate - have a history of data.

Main goal - be able to do research without, evidence being led back to you.

Serious sock puppets should use dedicated hardware.
A laptop specifically for sock puppet only activities.
A burner phone

dont use your personal IP address. VPNs may work.
