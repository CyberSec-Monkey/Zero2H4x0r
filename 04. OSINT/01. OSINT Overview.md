the use of multiple methodologies for collecting, analysing and making decisions about data using publicly available sources. 

Note - the majority of OSINT will be based in OSINT


The intelligence life cycle.

Planning and Direction:
The IC establishes intelligence priorities and objectives based on national security requirements.
Strategic planning and guidance are provided to guide intelligence collection and analysis efforts.

Collection:
Various intelligence agencies and assets within the IC collect information through different means such as signals intelligence, imagery intelligence, human intelligence, and open-source intelligence.

Processing and Exploitation:
The collected information undergoes processing and exploitation, which involves sorting, filtering, and transforming the raw data into a usable format.
Advanced technical capabilities are employed to extract valuable intelligence from different data sources.

Analysis and Production:
Intelligence analysts within the IC analyze the processed data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
They evaluate the significance of the intelligence and produce analytical assessments, reports, and briefings.

Dissemination and Integration:
The analyzed intelligence is disseminated to policymakers, military commanders, and other consumers within the IC and the broader national security community.
Intelligence products are integrated with other sources of information and fused to provide a comprehensive understanding of the security environment.
