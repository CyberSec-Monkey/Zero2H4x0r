Use multiple tools to get a complete view of results. no 1 tools is perfect.

once compiled a list, cat out the list into (sort -u = unique) into httprobe to ensure the domain is alive. Returned result is alive.

```
subfinder -d tcm-sec.com
assetfinder tcm-sec.com
amass enum -d tcm-sec.com

cat tesla.txt | sort -u | httprobe -s -p https:443
```

Go witness will take a snapshot of the site allows for visual checking

```
gowitness file -f ./alive.txt -P ./pics --no-http
```
