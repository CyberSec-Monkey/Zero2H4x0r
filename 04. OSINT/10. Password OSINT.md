------------------------

Dehashed is a paid site.
Has a lot of linked data. Email, Uname, IPs, addresses etc

Hashes.org
ability to search against a password hash

Have i been pwned - great site for identifying if an account has been caught in a breach. But wont give passwords.

scylla - good, usable. not as trougher as the paid services.

General logic;
checking against org or person or email
check against found password hashes to find linked accounts.
round and round
Collect as much data as possible. build the links.
