## Windows Subsystem for Linux

The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a compatibility layer in Windows that allows you to run a Linux environment directly on a Windows system. It enables you to run native Linux command-line tools and utilities alongside your Windows applications, providing a convenient way to develop and run Linux software on a Windows machine. WSL provides different distributions of Linux, such as Ubuntu, Debian, and SUSE, which can be installed and used within the Windows environment.

Released in 2016 - and has inherent vulnerabilities

If it has root - you can create a bind shell on any port.

> With root privileges Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) allows users to create a bind shell on any port (no elevation needed). Don't know the root password? No problem just set the default user to root W/ .exe --default-user root. Now start your bind shell or reverse.

```
wsl whoami
./ubuntun1604.exe config --default-user root
wsl whoami
wsl python -c 'BIND_OR_REVERSE_SHELL_PYTHON_CODE'

```
Binary `bash.exe` can also be found in `C:\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-lxssbash_[...]\bash.exe`

Alternatively you can explore the `WSL` filesystem in the folder `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\`
