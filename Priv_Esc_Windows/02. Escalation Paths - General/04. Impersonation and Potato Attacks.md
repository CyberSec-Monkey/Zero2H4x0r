## Token Impersonation and Potato Attacks

Token - like  a cookie for a PC to enable access to system or network.

2 types

- Delegate - Created for logging into a machine using Remote Desktop
- Impersonate - "non-interactive" such as attaching a network drive or a domain logon script.

Most seen is Delegate.
Think an admin logs into a machine. This leaves a token behind that  a malicious actor can use to impersonate the admin. 
Tokens don't go away until the machine is rebooted.


Think running mimikatz get some LSAs
