## Cleartext Passwords

### Search for them

```
findstr /si password *.txt
findstr /si password *.xml
findstr /si password *.ini

#Find all those strings in config files.
dir /s *pass* == *cred* == *vnc* == *.config*

# Find all passwords in all files.
findstr /spin "password" *.*
findstr /spin "password" *.*
```

### In Files

These are common files to find them in. They might be base64-encoded. So look out for that.

```
c:\sysprep.inf
c:\sysprep\sysprep.xml
c:\unattend.xml
%WINDIR%\Panther\Unattend\Unattended.xml
%WINDIR%\Panther\Unattended.xml

dir c:\*vnc.ini /s /b
dir c:\*ultravnc.ini /s /b 
dir c:\ /s /b | findstr /si *vnc.ini
```

### In Registry

```
# VNC
reg query "HKCU\Software\ORL\WinVNC3\Password"

# Windows autologin
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\Winlogon"

# SNMP Paramters
reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\Current\ControlSet\Services\SNMP"

# Putty
reg query "HKCU\Software\SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions"

# Search for password in registry
reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s
reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s
```
